Food Storage


# Storage by food:

## Pineapple

Pineapple is one of those exotic fruits that is extremely sensitive to cold. It is best stored whole at room temperature. Pre-cut pineapple will keep for two to three days in the refrigerator if covered with cling film.

For canned pineapple, the following applies: Opened pineapple will last longer if transferred to a sealable plastic container and stored in the refrigerator.

Tip: Remove the cut pineapple from the refrigerator well in advance of consumption and do not eat it ice cold. This is the only way to ensure its full flavor develops.

## Apples

Apples don't belong in the refrigerator. They are best stored in dark, cool pantries. The following applies:

Only healthy, completely undamaged fruit is suitable for storage;

Always store apples separately from other fruits and vegetables, as they emit the ripening gas ethylene, which causes other ethylene-sensitive fruits to spoil more quickly;

Optimal temperature: 1°C - 3°C;

Humidity should be 85-90%;

Avoid condensation;

Place them in a single layer on shelves or in wooden boxes, with or without a paper base – if possible so that the fruits don't touch each other; cover if necessary; make sure that no bruises are created.

Tip: Even floury apples can still be used to enhance desserts with syrup, lemon juice, or cinnamon. Sliced, they can also be dried and will keep longer – a sweet but healthy snack for between meals.

## Eggplants

Also called aubergines. Eggplants are cold-sensitive vegetables and therefore should not be refrigerated.

## Avocados

Avocados are among the ethylene-producing fruits that should not be refrigerated and should definitely be kept separate from other fruits and vegetables. The reason: they spoil faster otherwise.

Tip: If you buy unripe avocados, you can speed up the ripening process by storing them in a paper bag at room temperature, for example, with an apple.

## Bananas

Bananas are exotic fruits that are accustomed to warmth. They have the longest shelf life above 16°C and therefore should not be refrigerated. Unripe bananas ripen quickly if stored in a plastic bag at room temperature.


## Berries

Berries have a short shelf life. They last longest when stored in a consistently cool, dry place, ideally unwashed in a shallow container in the refrigerator.

Tip: When pureed and frozen, they are suitable for even longer use as an ingredient in desserts or milkshakes.

Caution: Since berries are sensitive to ethylene, it is important to store them separately from ethylene-producing varieties. This works best in closed containers. With berries, it is also advisable to ensure that they are not left in their own juice or in condensation – this leads to mold growth.


## Pears

Pears should not be stored in the refrigerator, but preferably in a cool, dark pantry. The following applies:

Only healthy, completely undamaged fruit is suitable for storage;

Always store pears separately from other fruits and vegetables, as they release the ripening gas ethylene, causing other ethylene-sensitive fruits to spoil more quickly;

Optimal temperature: 1°C - 3°C;

Humidity should be 85-90%;

Avoid condensation;

With or without a paper base, if possible, so that the fruits do not touch each other – place them in a single layer on shelves or in wooden boxes; cover if necessary; ensure that no bruises occur.

## Beans

Beans will stay fresh for up to two days in a container that's as airy as possible in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator.

Tip: Wilted beans will become crisp again if placed in ice-cold water for about 15 minutes before cooking.


## Broccoli

Fresh broccoli can be recognized by its vibrant color and closed flowers. It should be stored in a cool place, ideally in plastic wrap in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator. This way, it will last for up to three days. If broccoli is stored in too warm a place, it loses at least ten percent of its vitamin C content every day.

Tip: If you don't have time to use it fresh, we recommend blanching it briefly and then freezing it. This kills the enzymes that cause it to spoil faster.


## Chinese Cabbage

Chinese cabbage can be stored for months if it is individually wrapped in paper and placed vertically in boxes without being crushed. It should be stored in a cool, dark place, but should not be refrigerated.


## Dates

Dates are available fresh, dried, or frozen. Generally speaking, the higher the sugar content, the longer they will keep. Fresh dates will keep for up to two weeks in the refrigerator, and even up to six months if frozen.

Caution: The longer they are stored in a cool place, the more the dates will dry out and lose their flavor.


## Endive

Endive can be stored for months if it is individually wrapped in paper and placed vertically in crates without being crushed. It can also last for several weeks if hung from the cellar ceiling.

## Potatoes

Potatoes are among the cold-sensitive vegetables. Therefore, they should not be refrigerated, but should still be stored in as cool a place as possible.

Since potatoes turn green when exposed to light and all green parts of the plant contain the toxic solanine, it is important to ensure absolute darkness in the storage area.

Tip: When storing in the cellar, it is recommended to place green fern fronds between the potatoes to ward off mice and other rodents, as their scent is said to repel such predators.

## Strawberries

Strawberries don't mind being near other fruits or vegetables. They keep best when stored in a consistently cool, dry place, ideally unwashed in a shallow container in the refrigerator.

## Lamb's Lettuce

Lettuce should always be kept in the refrigerator, where it will stay fresh for up to five days. 5°C and high humidity are ideal. Therefore, storage in the vegetable drawer is recommended.

## Figs

Ripe fruits such as figs will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days, depending on their ripeness. Caution: When storing, make sure that ethylene-producing varieties, such as figs, are separated from ethylene-sensitive varieties. This works best when stored in closed containers.

## Fennel

Fresh fennel is recognizable by its firm, white to light green bulb. It is less robust than it looks. Bruises should be avoided and the vegetable should be stored in a cool place, preferably in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator.

## Green Beans

Green beans are best stored in a damp cloth in the vegetable drawer at a temperature of 5°C - 10°C. However, they should be used quickly, as they only last for a maximum of two days, even in the refrigerator.

## Spring Onions

Spring onions, also called leeks, have a less intense flavor than regular onions, but are much more delicate. They will keep fresh in the refrigerator for a maximum of one week.

Tip: The spring onion can be used whole. Both the white and green parts are suitable for consumption, raw, cooked, or sautéed.

## Yellow Beets

See root vegetables


## Cucumbers

Cucumbers are particularly water-rich. They don't like the cold and therefore shouldn't be refrigerated. Cucumbers are among the vegetables that not only produce ethylene but are also sensitive to it themselves. For this reason, they should not be stored together with other ethylene producers. If they are stored near peppers, broccoli, spinach, potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, leeks, chili peppers, mushrooms, or tomatoes, they will quickly become wrinkled and spoil faster.

## Blueberries and raspberries

will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days, depending on their ripeness.

Caution: Since berries are sensitive to ethylene, it's important to keep them separate from ethylene-producing varieties when storing them. This works best in closed containers. With berries, it's also advisable to ensure they don't sit in their own juices or in condensation – this leads to mold growth.

## Ginger

Ginger is not only healthy, it also has a warming effect, making it especially suitable for the cold season. Fresh ginger will keep for several weeks in foil or a container in the refrigerator.


## Currants

Currants will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days, depending on their ripeness.

Caution: Since berries are sensitive to ethylene, it's important to keep them separate from ethylene-producing varieties. This works best in closed containers. With berries, it's also advisable to ensure they don't sit in their own juices or in condensation – this leads to mold growth.


## Cauliflower

Fresh cauliflower should be stored in a cool place, ideally wrapped in plastic wrap in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator. This way, it will keep for up to three days. It's less robust than it looks. It's advisable to avoid bruising, as brown spots quickly develop.

## Carrots

Carrots are best stored in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator.

Tip: They will taste crisp and fresh again if placed in a glass of water for a few minutes.


## Cherries

Cherries should be consumed within two to three days. They retain their freshness longer if stored in the refrigerator with the stem on.

Tip for pitting the fruit: A few minutes in the freezer makes the stone easier to remove and the flesh remains firmer.

## Kiwi

The kiwi is one of the few exotic fruits that can tolerate refrigeration. Ripe kiwis will keep in the vegetable drawer for up to two weeks. Unripe kiwis are best kept at room temperature. This allows them to ripen and develop their full flavor.

## Garlic

Garlic should be stored in a cool, dry, and dark place. However, it should never be refrigerated. Special garlic containers are best: ceramic pots that can be closed with a lid and have air holes for sufficient oxygen. Just like onions, garlic can also be tied into braids and hung up.

Tip: Individual garlic cloves will last longer if marinated in oil. Adding herbs can also create a particularly delicious aroma.

## Cabbage, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts

Cabbage and cabbage are the local vitamin C bombs for the winter! They are best stored in a cool, dark place.

Important: The outer leaves should be removed before storage. Already cut heads will stay fresher longer if wrapped in film in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator.

## Horseradish

Horseradish is suitable for storage in the vegetable drawer, where it will keep for three to four days.

Tip: Spring-harvested horseradish is significantly milder than winter-harvested horseradish, which can even be bitterly hot. If you want to tone it down, sprinkle it with salt or heat it up.

## Squash

Squash should not be stored too cool, as this can cause rot to set in more quickly. If you can't provide them with the ideal temperature of 12°C - 16°C, it's better to store them warmer than colder – the effect is that they dry out faster and the skin becomes harder. The stems indicate the right time to enjoy them by beginning to loosen.

## Leek

After harvesting, place the plants tightly together and wrap them in a damp cloth; store in a cool cellar; do not expose the cut plant to subzero temperatures.

## Limes

Cut limes can be stored cut-side down on a plate in the refrigerator.

## Mandarins

Mandarins will keep for several weeks if stored in a cool, dry, and dark place. Like most citrus fruits, they don't tolerate cold. Therefore, mandarins don't belong in the refrigerator, but are best stored in a fruit bowl.

Tip: These fruits have a high vitamin C content and, in addition to being eaten raw, are particularly good for refining salads, meat, and fish dishes.

## Mangos

Mangos are exotic fruits that thrive in warm temperatures. They have the longest shelf life above 16°C and therefore should not be refrigerated.


## Chard

Leafy greens should always be kept in the refrigerator, where they will stay fresh for up to five days. 5°C and high humidity are ideal. Therefore, storage in the vegetable drawer is recommended.

## Apricots

Apricots will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days. Since they are among the ethylene-sensitive fruits, care must be taken to separate them from ethylene-producing fruits and vegetables. Storage in sealed containers is optimal.


## Melons

Whole melons are best stored at room temperature. The already cut fruit, covered with cling film, will keep for another two to three days in the refrigerator.

Tip: You can determine the ripeness of a melon by tapping the skin. If the sound is deep and dull, the water content is high and the fruit is ripe.


## Nectarines

Nectarines keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days. Since they are among the ethylene-sensitive fruits, care should be taken to separate them from ethylene-producing fruits and vegetables. Storage in sealed containers is optimal.


## Nuts

Unpeeled and whole nuts can be stored for months if stored in a cool, dry, and dark place. Shelled or grated nuts will keep for up to four weeks in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Tip: Nuts are easier to chop when they are warm and moist.


## Oranges

Oranges will keep for several weeks if stored in a cool, dry, and dark place. Like most citrus fruits, oranges don't tolerate cold. Therefore, they shouldn't be refrigerated but are best stored in a fruit bowl.

Tip: Oranges are high in vitamin C and, in addition to being eaten raw, are also particularly good for refining salads, meat, and fish dishes.



## Peppers

Peppers are best stored at a temperature of 5°C - 10°C, preferably not in the refrigerator. Red peppers have the most aromatic compounds and the highest vitamin C content.

Important: Peppers must be thoroughly cleaned before consumption, as this popular vegetable is often particularly contaminated with pesticides.

## Tomatoes

Tomatoes cannot be overwintered when fresh. Green-harvested tomatoes ripen without problems at 10°C and above – the refrigerator would be too cold for this.
Since tomatoes produce a lot of ethylene, they should not be stored next to ethylene-sensitive varieties.

Tip: Tomatoes can be diced or frozen whole and used later in sauces. Dried tomatoes are particularly tasty: halved, deseeded, and baked in the oven at 50°C with the door slightly ajar, they become an intense seasoning for pasta sauces or antipasti.


## Pepperoni

Pepperoni are best stored at a temperature of 5°C - 10°C, preferably not in the refrigerator.

Tip: Before using, carefully remove all seeds and inner membranes and then briefly place the pepperoni in boiling water. This will make the peppers milder, but it will also reduce some of their aroma.

## Peaches

Peaches will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days.

Caution: Since peaches are sensitive to ethylene, it is important to store them separately from ethylene-producing varieties. This works best in closed containers.

## Plums

Plums will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days. Avoid storing them directly next to other ethylene-producing and sensitive fruits and vegetables. Storage in closed containers is optimal.


## Mushrooms

Mushrooms have a water content of over 90% and should be stored in a cool, airy place. A permeable container in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator is ideal for this. Mushrooms should never be left in a plastic bag for too long – risk of mold! Braised, dried, or canned mushrooms have the longest shelf life. Frozen mushrooms can be kept for up to six months.

Tip: Never thaw mushrooms before preparation; always store them directly in the pot.


## Quinces

Quinces usually have a slightly greenish hue when purchased and will continue to ripen. They can be kept for up to eight weeks if stored in a cool room.

Important: The fruits should be stored separately from other fruits and vegetables, otherwise they will lose their full flavor. If the quince is lemon yellow and the seeds are dark, it is ideal for consumption.


## Radishes

Radishes are suitable for storage in the vegetable compartment, where they will keep for three to four days.

Tip: Small radishes are best stored wrapped in a damp kitchen towel in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator. The green parts and root strands should be removed beforehand. They draw unnecessary moisture from the vegetables.

Tip: Radishes will taste crisp and fresh again even after a few days if placed in a glass of water for a few minutes.

Tip: Spring radishes are much milder than winter radishes, which can even be quite spicy. If you want to tone them down, sprinkle them with salt or heat them.

## Rhubarb

Rhubarb is best wrapped in a damp towel and stored in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator. Avoid storing it close to ethylene-producing fruits and vegetables.

Caution: Rhubarb should not be stored in aluminum or metal containers, nor should it be cooked in aluminum pots. Its acid attacks the coating or even bonds with it.

## Currants

Currants will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days, depending on their ripeness.

Caution: Since berries are sensitive to ethylene, it's important to keep them separate from ethylene-producing varieties. This works best in closed containers. With berries, it's also advisable to ensure they don't sit in their own juices or in condensation – this leads to mold growth.

## Beets

## Red Cabbage

Red cabbage is stored differently depending on the season. Heads from the summer harvest will last a maximum of five to ten days in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator. Winter red cabbage, on the other hand, will keep for several months. The cut surface can be covered with film and stored in the vegetable drawer. Red cabbage is also suitable for freezing, whether raw, blanched, or processed.

Tip: Wear household gloves when handling red cabbage. The dye is difficult to wash off skin.


## Arugula

## Asparagus

Green asparagus tastes a bit heartier than white asparagus. It contains more vitamin C and carotene, doesn't need to be peeled, and cooks much faster. If not used immediately, asparagus will keep longest if wrapped unpeeled in a damp cloth in the vegetable drawer of the refrigerator.

Tip: You can tell whether the asparagus in the supermarket is really fresh by its juicy cut surfaces.

## Spinach

Leafy greens should always be refrigerated, where they will stay fresh for up to five days. 5°C and high humidity are ideal. Therefore, storage in the vegetable drawer is recommended.


## Grapes

Grapes last about two to ten days in the refrigerator.

Caution: Since grapes are sensitive to ethylene, it's important to keep them separate from ethylene-producing varieties when storing them. This works best in closed containers. With grapes, it's also advisable to ensure they don't sit in their own juice or in condensation – this leads to mold growth.

## Lamb's Lettuce

Lettuce should always be kept in the refrigerator, where it will stay fresh for up to five days. 5°C and high humidity are ideal. Therefore, storage in the vegetable drawer is recommended.


## Root Vegetables

Carrots, turnips, parsley roots, radishes, swedes, celery root, and beetroot are best stored in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator wrapped in cling film. This keeps the vegetables moist and fresh for up to three weeks.

Tip: The cling film should be opened slightly every now and then to prevent the moisture underneath and the roots and tubers from rotting.

## Lemons

Cut lemons can be stored cut-side down on a plate in the refrigerator.

## Zucchini

Zucchini should never be stored below 5°C and are best kept fresh in the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator for up to a week.

## Onions

Onions should never be refrigerated. A dry, cool, and dark room with regular ventilation is ideal. Baskets or clay pots, whose holes allow gentle airflow through the container, also meet this requirement. Onions can also be braided and hung, just like garlic.

## Plums

Plums will keep in the refrigerator for about two to ten days. Here, too, it is important to ensure they are stored directly next to other ethylene-producing and ethylene-sensitive fruits and vegetables. Storage in sealed containers is optimal.






# Refrigerator: What Goes Where?

Most refrigerators have multiple temperature zones. These zones are created by setting the middle compartment to about seven degrees Celsius. The coldest spot is then on the lowest shelf. This is the optimal place for perishable foods such as meat and fish. Milk and dairy products, cheese, and sausages, as well as vegetarian or vegan products from the refrigerated section, are well-suited to the shelves above. Prepared meals, milk, and plant-based drinks also keep best here.

The door is the warmest place. Only foods that need to be cooled slightly, such as opened drinks, butter and margarine, sauces, and tubes, should be kept here. Milk and plant-based drinks should only be kept in the door compartment as an exception, if they will be consumed very soon.

The vegetable compartment is separated from the rest of the interior by the glass panel above. It is two to three degrees warmer than the average interior temperature. All refrigerator-safe fruits and vegetables are stored in this compartment.
